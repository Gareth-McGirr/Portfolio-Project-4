**Navigation Links**

Testing was performed to ensure all navigation links on the respective pages, navigated to the correct pages as per design. This was done by clicking on the navigation links on each page.

| Navigation Link | Page to Load    |
| --------------- | --------------- |
|                 |                 |




**Footer**

**Validator Testing**

All pages were run through the [w3 HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). Initially there were some errors due to stray script tags, misuse of headings within spans and some unclosed elements. All of these issues were corrected and all pages passed validation.

Due to the django templating language code used in the HTML files, these could not be copy and pasted into the validator and due to the secured views, pages with login required or a secured view cannot be validated by direct URI. To test the validation on the files, open the page to validate, right click and view page source. Paste the raw html code into the validator as this will be only the HTML rendered code.

All pages were run through the official [Pep8](http://pep8online.com/) validator to ensure all code was pep8 compliant. Some errors were shown due to blank spacing and lines too long, 1 line instead of 2 expected. All of these errors were resolved and code passed through validators with the exception of the settings.py file.

The django auto generated code for AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS were showing up as lines too long. I could not find a way to split these lines but since they were auto generated and not my own custom code, I hope this is acceptable.

JavaScript code was run through [JSHINT](jshint.com) javascript validator. lIt flagged up issues with undefined variables as I jad forgotten to use the let keyword. This was fixed and the only warnings remained were that they were unused variables. The functions were called via onclick from the html elements themselves, so are in fact being used.

**Lighthouse Report**

Lighthouse report showed areas for improvement on SEO and Best practices. Meta descriptions and keywords were added to boost the SEO to 100 but the best practice warnings were coming from the use of an embedded iframe's javascript. Unfortunately I did not find a way to improve this as I am not initialising the google map iframe with javascript.
